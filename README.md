# Cross Check
Cross Check is a Ruby group project using data from the NHL to analyze team performance for specific seasons and across multiple seasons. This project focused on determining who the best and worst performers are, as well as allowing us to pull statistics for individual teams, done through using a StatTracker as our CLI. 

## Contributors
Cross Check was written by Tylor Schafer, Leiya Kenney, Mack Halliday, and Danny Moran as a Back End Mod 1 project at Turing School of Software and Design.

## Comments
With such a large dataset, imported from CSV files, TDD was essential, and mock data was used for testing and the entire project was run against a spec harness to ensure accuracy of the code. Mocks and stubs were also utilized where necessary in order to fully test the code.
As we had not yet been introduced to Github Projects, to ensure success with this project, we utilized Google Sheets to keep each other accountable and share helper methods being created in order to keep our code as dry as possible.
