# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  Nested collections - we want to get that down and feel comfortable doing them. Also looking forward to pulling lots of data and compiling it into usable formats.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  Mostly pair programming for setup, but we're all good with either, but like having some time to work on own.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  Slack is a good option for communication, but within reason for actual number of messages sent so we don't get lost. Keep feedback/communication positive.
  Mack works late, so may send slack messages late - not expected to respond immediately to those.
* How would you describe your work style?
  Mack/Tylor/Danny - later in the night
  Leiya - mornings
  Mack/Leiya - frequent breaks
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  Mack - good at .csv files
  Tylor - works well in groups, good at positive reinforcement
  Leiya - worked in a lot of group settings, spent a lot of time around data
  Danny - familiar with datasets & assessing them
  Group work should be fairly easy for us, with positive reinforcements, and the data shouldn't scare us too much.
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  Gap in the learning curve = not contributing enough to the team overall. Getting a lot done individually and make sure it matches up worked well. Being able to read other peoples' code to figure out what it means. Make sure to commit frequently/pull down the master when we've merged it.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  Broad concepts and go from there; use an outline that we all agree on with internal deadlines that can be reassessed as we go along.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  Positivity and communication with a good attitude :) be clear on next steps for each person involved.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  Danny would prefer not to code at home, but is happy to meet up whenever.
  Leiya prefers not to work at home, but can meet whenever/wherever else.
  Group check-ins at the end of the day with what we've accomplished and what we're moving on to.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  Mack - no Tuesday or Wednesday or Sunday night this week, or Monday night next week.
  Tylor - no Sunday
  Leiya - no Tuesday or Thursday lunch, Thursday after work if possible
  Danny - normally here 2 hours early & can stay late as needed, but will need pairing sessions with mentor once in a while, would rather not work at lunch
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  Negative/coaching feedback is difficult to give sometimes, but we're open to receiving the feedback. If there's something going wrong, we want to bring it up as soon as possible so it doesn't fester.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  Biggest strength(s): Iteration, TDD (Tylor), .csv files & logic/structure (Mack), TDD (Leiya), readiness to learn/improve (Danny)
  Improvement area(s): Nested collections (Leiya, Mack, Tylor), enumerables (Danny)
  Hold each other accountable, working together and explaining our processes
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  Gist w/check boxes for each Iteration + rubric
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  Work on the problem for ~30 min, if you're still stuck, reach out to the Slack channel to get un-stuck.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  Equal contribution, everyone understands all the code written.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  Verbal affirmation/recognition when we do good things.
