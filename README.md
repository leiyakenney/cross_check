# Cross Check

Group project for Turing Back End Engineering Mod 1 project. 

Using data from the NHL, this group project analyzed team performance both for specific seasons and across multiple seasons. This project focused on determining who the best and worst performers are, as well as allowing us to pull statistics for individual teams, done through using a StatTracker as our CLI. 
With such a large dataset, imported from CSV files, TDD was essential, and mock data was used for testing and the entire project was run against a spec harness to ensure accuracy of the code. Mocks and stubs were also utilized where necessary in order to fully test the code.
To ensure progress with this project, we utilized Google Sheets to keep each other accountable and share helper methods being created in order to keep our code as dry as possible.
